AIM:

To represent a Markov Decision Process(MDP) problem in the following ways:

Text representation

Graphical representation

Python - Dictonary representation
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

A toddler is learning to walk. The toddler starts out by crawling, and then eventually learns to stand up and walk. The toddler must learn to balance itself and take steps, while also avoiding obstacles.
Problem Description

The toddler has to reach the goal state(moving forward to target) by taking the correct step towards the goal without hitting any obstacles or losing balance. After reaching the goal the toddler will be rewarded if not then no reward will be provided.

State Space :

{S,B,G,O}->{0,1,2,3

0-> Starting point (S)
  
1-> Balanced walking (B)
  
2-> Targeted point (G)

3-> Dashed onto obstacle (O)

Sample State

B-> 1-> Balanced walking
Action Space

{W,C}->{1,2}

W-> Walking

C-> Crawling
Sample Action

W-> 1-> Walking

C-> 2-> Crawling
Reward Function

R =
{
    +1, if : the toddler comes to the targeted point
    0, else : no reward
}

RESULT:
Thus, to represent a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem in the representation of text, graphical and also by python program by displaying an appropriate dictionary for the above mentioned problem is implemented and executed successfully.
